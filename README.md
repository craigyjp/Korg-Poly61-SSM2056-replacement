- Korg Poly61 SSM2056 replacement with Electric Druid EnvGen8C

I bought a very poorly Poly61 for a 100 euros, I was told it was just missing the EG chips (SSM2056) but it had a battery leak, all 6 EG chips missing, a dead keyboard and lots of corrosion issues. I fixed it up and replaced the SSM2056 chips with cheap EnvGen8C chips from Electric Druid and two opamps to adjust the CV's for the SSM chips to the 0-5v standard that the EnvGen8C chips understand.
